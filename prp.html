        <h1>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)</h1>
        <p class="common p">
          PRP is an innovative treatment that harnesses the body’s healing
          abilities. PRP involves a blood draw, which is then treated to
          create a sample dense with platelets. That sample is then
          re-injected into the body to stimulate healing and growth.
          Historically, PRP has been used to treat injured tendons, joints,
          and muscles. It has recently been developed as a cosmetic treatment
          for hair loss and skin rejuvenation. Dr. Azmal has had success in
          using PRP to treat hair loss in men and women.

        <h2>What is PRP injection used for?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>PRP for skin volume</h3>
            <p class="common p">
              As previously mentioned, PRP can be used on the skin to
              stimulate healing after cosmetic dermatology procedures. What’s
              more, PRP has been shown to promote the body’s own natural
              production of collagen; helping the skin appear more full and
              youthful. This can be done by directly injecting PRP into the
              soft tissue where there is volume loss, or applying topically to
              a scar or before/after laser or microneedling treatment.
              Injecting PRP into soft tissue is a great option for those with
              minimal volume loss and are not candidates for traditional
              dermal fillers. PRP injections into soft tissue works by
              delivering the growth factor platelets directly into areas of
              volume loss, resulting in collagen stimulation. With any
              injection, there is always a chance of bruising and mild
              swelling
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>PRP For Hair loss</h3>
            <p class="common p">
              Dr. Azmal suggests the treatment that he feels will best resolve
              your hair loss concerns and provide the most effective hair
              restoration. It’s possible that Dr. Azmal will suggest that you
              combine PRP treatments with additional treatments, carboxy
              therapy to get best results. PRP treatments may help to restore
              thinning or damaged hair follicles, resulting in thicker,
              healthier hair. In short, the concentrated, bio-rich platelets
              that our experts extract from your blood are injected directly
              into the scalp.Dr. Azmal and his team are always available to
              answer questions about hair loss and the potential treatments
              including platelet rich plasma. If you are concerned about hair
              loss and want to learn more, contact his office to make an
              appointment for a consultation today.

            <h3>PRP for skin rejuvination</h3>
            <p class="common p">
              PRP treatment id used for skin rejuvenation, and is also known
              as a "vampire facelift". The PRP facelift is a non-surgical
              facelift for used for improving skin quality naturally using
              your own platelets. PRP can be added to any laser or
              microneedling treatment to help expedite healing, decrease the
              appearance of scars and promote collagen production.
              Microneedling: The Platelet Rich Plasma is placed directly on
              the skin, pre and post the microneedling procedure. One of our
              favorite treatments to combine with PRP is our “Intensif”
              treatment, which is radiofrequency microneedling. The tiny
              needles push the PRP into the tissue and also create tiny
              channels for the PRP to be absorbed into the skin
              post-procedure. Patients will generally leave with a mask of PRP
              and a moisturizer. Most patients benefit from 3 treatments,
              spaced one month apart, but those with deeper acne scars may
              require 5 monthly treatments.
            </p>

          <li>
            <h3>The PRP therapy procedure</h3>
            <p class="common p">
              The procedure is performed in our out-patient clinic and can
              take up to an hour to complete. The 3 main steps of the
              procedure are outlined below: 1) Blood sample is drawn from a
              vein in your arm. 2) Your sample is spun in a centrifuge machine
              which separates the desired components 3)The concentration of
              platelets is injected into your treatment site The treatment is
              generally administered at three weekly intervals. Since the
              treatment is prepared from your own blood, the treatment carries
              a low risk. The number of injections required depends on the
              objective of treatment but can range from two to six injections
              which are performed at weekly intervals.

              Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy involves the injection of the
              patient's own platelets for skin rejuvenation in the cosmetic
              treatment of anti-ageing wrinkles or scars in the face, hands,
              and neck. Platelets are used to stimulate new collagen
              naturally, through the routes of regenerative medicine.

        <h2>
          What should I expect during the treatment?
          <span class="icon"></span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          In our clinic, PRP begins with a consultation to understand the
          current condition of deterioration in or injury to your joint. Once
          we’ve confirmed that the therapy is suitable for you, we’ll set a
          date and time for your treatment. On the day of treatment, your
          blood will be taken by a nurse or health assistant. This will then
          be processed to create the platelet-rich plasma, which will be
          injected directly into the affected area by your consultant

      <div class="content">
        <h2>
          Is Platelet Rich Plasma injection painful?
          <span class="icon"></span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          PRP injections are not painful, however, the discomfort level
          depends on the part of the body being treated. Injections into the
          joint are given minimal discomfort. PRP treatment of tendinitis can
          be given mild discomfort. Injections cosmetically are done following
          a local anesthetic which to apply to numb the areas being treated.
        </p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>
          Is Platelet Rich Plasma injection safe?<span class="icon"></span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          PRP is an especially safe treatment option with no risk of allergic
          reaction because it is your own blood.
